Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
============

# Third Week 
The dataSet needed to execute run_analisys.R represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The goal of this project is to have a new data set with athe observables grouped by the average value of each variable to each activity and subject.

The steps you have to perform in order to test this project are:

1. Download the zip file with all needed data from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
2. Unzip the dataSet in your working directory
3. Execute run_analysis.R in the same folder as the unziped data.
4. If you are success, then you have a new file "tidyDataSet.txt" with the  average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
